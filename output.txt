find top-10 words from 2-gram index file datarex . The original paper suggests to use uniforms with 2-grams find it , I replaced edit-distance because is much easier compute and still has very high correlation what was used in the Also Top takes into account length of word e.g closer - better From that top take each check probability occurence context previous based on 3-grams To work write your text input.txt result will be output.txt word and check the probability of occurence of that word in the context of previous words based on dataset of 3-grams . To check the work write your text into the input.txt file . The result will be in the output.txt .
